## General Information
- <b>About the case study:</b> Lending Club is a well-known online marketplace that connects borrowers seeking personal loans with potential investors. With its inception in 2007, the platform has facilitated more than $50 billion in loans. In this case study, we will examine the data provided by Lending Club to identify the characteristics of borrowers who are at a higher risk of loan default.
- <b>Business Problem that need to be solved:</b>  This company is the largest online loan marketplace, facilitating personal loans, business loans, and financing of medical procedures. Borrowers can easily access lower interest rate loans through a fast online interface. 

    Like most other lending companies, lending loans to ‘risky’ applicants is the largest source of financial loss (called credit loss). Credit loss is the amount of money lost by the lender when the borrower refuses to pay or runs away with the money owed. In other words, borrowers who default cause the largest amount of loss to the lenders. In this case, the customers labelled as 'charged-off' are the 'defaulters'. 
    If one is able to identify these risky loan applicants, then such loans can be reduced thereby cutting down the amount of credit loss. Identification of such applicants using EDA is the aim of this case study.

    In other words, the company wants to understand the driving factors (or driver variables) behind loan default, i.e. the variables which are strong indicators of default.  The company can utilise this knowledge for its portfolio and risk assessment. 
- <b>Dataset used:</b> The dataset that is being used for this have 39717 records and 111 features. The record present is from year 2007 till 2011.
